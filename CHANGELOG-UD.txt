 
Post vxi11 2.0 - 2021-04-13
---------------------------
These are the changes made on a clone of the official repository.  An
appropriate pull request will be made but for the time being the changes
are documented separately.

* Use tiRPC and link with appropriate libraries.  This is needed for
  modern Linux systems because the old SunRPC code is only available
  for compatibility
* Fix use of install which installs with execute permission by default
  which is wrong for the header file
* Fix potentially non-terminated string in _vxi11_client_t list which
  has a fixed-size buffer for a file name
* Handle fgets failure (e.g., on EOF) in vxi11_cmd. Actually return
  the error
